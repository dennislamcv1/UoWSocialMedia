    "    <li> As part of this shift, the original Tweepy Tweet Search API has changed where the course's <code>twitter_search.py</code><br> script may not run appropriately. In particular, the \"search\" API method used (api.search) has been removed. <br>\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/api.html\">Details on the currently available Tweepy methods can be found in Tweepy.org documentation here.</a></li>\n",

    "    <li>To find a functioning and easily accessible Twitter API that does not require Elevated Access, we recommend checking out Twitter's API v2 documentation for Esssential Access, including their <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction\">Twitter API v2 Data Dictionary</a> and <a ref=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/quick-start/recent-search\">Twitter API v2 Search Tweets endpoint documentation.</a><br> You may also find <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/apitools/api?endpoint=%2F2%2Ftweets%2Fsearch%2Fall&method=get\">Twitter's in-browser API Explorer tool </a>helpful for generating an API call in <code>!curl [query-url] >> outputfile.txt</code> <br> format, which you can run within a Jupyter Notebook cell or terminal to download Tweet data for your Peer Review Assessment. <br> Note: If you take this route, please be sure to follow formatting guidance of the Peer Review after download.</li><br>\n",
